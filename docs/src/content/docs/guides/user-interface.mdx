description: an overview of the rovr user interface and how to navigate it.
---

rovr's user interface has several panels that you can navigate between using the keyboard.

### panels

the main panels are:

- pinned folder sidebar: a list of your favorite or frequently accessed folders. (focus with `s`)
- file list: the main panel, showing the files and folders in the current directory.
- preview sidebar: shows a preview of the selected file or folder. (focus with `i`)
- footer: contains three smaller panels:
  - processes list: shows ongoing processes like copying or deleting files. (focus with `f6`)
  - metadata list: displays metadata for the selected item. (focus with `m`)
  - clipboard list: shows items that you have copied or cut. (focus with `c`)

to return focus to the main file list from any other panel, press `esc`.

### toggling panel visibility

you can show or hide panels to customize your view:

- pinned folder sidebar: `shift+s`
- preview sidebar: `shift+i`
- footer (all three panels): `shift+f`

### compact mode

rovr supports a compact mode for smaller terminal windows or when you want to maximize the file list space. in compact mode, the footer panels automatically hide when they're not in use, giving you more space for file browsing.

To enable compact mode, set the following in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[interface]
compact_mode = true
```

### tabs

rovr supports tabs to manage multiple file list views simultaneously.

- create a new tab: `n`
- close the current tab: `w`
- go to the next tab: `ctrl+j`
- go to the previous tab: `ctrl+k`

### help and shortcuts

- view all available keybindings: `?` - this opens a help screen showing all available shortcuts and their functions
