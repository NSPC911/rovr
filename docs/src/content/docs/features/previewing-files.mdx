import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

`rovr` includes a powerful preview sidebar that can display the contents of various filetypes.

### text files

![file preview](/rovr/screenshots/preview-file.svg)

plain text files are displayed in a text area with syntax highlighting. the language is determined by the file extension. `rovr` supports a wide range of languages.

### bat plugin

![file preview with bat](/rovr/screenshots/preview-file-bat.svg)

if you have [`bat`](/rovr/features/plugins#bat) installed and enabled in the `rovr` config, it will be used to display text files with syntax highlighting for much more languages and theming.

### images

<sub>no screenshots, they don't play nicely with svg</sub>

`rovr` can display images directly in the terminal. refer to the [image previews](/rovr/features/image-previews) guide for more details on terminal compatibility and configuration.

### folders

![folder preview](/rovr/screenshots/preview-folder.svg)

when a folder is selected, the preview panel will show a list of the files and folders inside it, allowing you to see the contents without navigating into it.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you focus on the folder preview, you can navigate in there to open files and folders, letting you skip actually cd-ing into it!

### archives

![archive preview](/rovr/screenshots/preview-archive.svg)

for archive files (like `.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.rar`), rovr will display a list of the files and folders contained within the archive.
