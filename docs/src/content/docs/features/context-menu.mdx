## navigation with the context menu

when the context menu is open:

- **select action**: `enter` or click
- **close menu**: `esc` or click outside the menu

## double-click behavior

{/* <add image> */}

in addition to the context menu, rovr supports double-clicking:
- **on folders**: opens the folder (same as pressing `enter`)
- **on files**: attempts to open the file with the default application

the double-click delay can be configured in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[settings]
# time in seconds between clicks to register as double-click
double_click_delay = 0.25
```

## mouse scroll

{/* <add image> */}

you can also use your mouse wheel to scroll through the file list when hovering over it.
