{/* <add image> */}

rovr provides multiple ways to sort files and folders in the file list, allowing you to organize your view based on different criteria.

## accessing the sort menu

{/* <add image> */}

You can access the sort menu by:
- clicking the sort button in the action button menu
- the sort button displays the current sort order icon and direction
- use the sort order switcher to quickly cycle through different sort orders

## sort criteria

rovr supports the following sort options:

### sort by name

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files alphabetically by their name. This is the default sorting method.

- **keybinding**: `a` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A)

### sort by extension

{/* <add image> */}

Groups files by their file extension, making it easy to find files of the same type together.

- **keybinding**: `e` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending or descending

### sort by natural order

{/* <add image> */}

Uses natural sorting, which handles numbers in file names more intuitively (e.g., "file2" comes before "file10").

- **keybinding**: `n` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending or descending

### sort by size

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by their size, useful for finding large or small files quickly.

- **keybinding**: `s` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (smallest first) or descending (largest first)

### sort by created time

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by their creation time.

- **keybinding**: `c` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (oldest first) or descending (newest first)

### sort by modified time

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by their last modification time.

- **keybinding**: `m` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (oldest first) or descending (newest first)

## toggling sort direction

{/* <add image> */}

You can toggle between ascending and descending order:
- **keybinding**: `d` (when sort menu is open)
- this switches the current sort order between ascending and descending

The sort menu dynamically updates to show the current direction for each sort option.

## sort order switcher

{/* <add image> */}

The sort order switcher provides a quick way to cycle through different sort orders without opening the sort menu:

- **location**: displayed in the action button area
- **functionality**: click to cycle through available sort orders
- **visual feedback**: shows the current sort type and direction with appropriate icons

## persistence

{/* <add image> */}

Your sort preferences are automatically saved and persist between sessions using the **state manager**. When you close and reopen rovr, it will remember:
- your selected sort criteria (name, size, extension, etc.)
- your sort direction (ascending or descending)

These preferences apply to all tabs and are managed by the state manager, which stores application state in the `state.toml` file in your rovr configuration directory.
