[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) allows you to zip around your filesystem, and can be integrated into rovr

- **enable:** `plugins.zoxide.enabled = true`
- **keybinding:** the default keybinding to open the zoxide dialog is `z`.

### bat

to allow for more file previews, [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) can be used for its syntax highlighting capabilities.

- **enable:** `plugins.bat.enabled = true`
- **executable:** specify the path to the `bat` executable if it's not in your system's `PATH`.
- **line numbers:** toggle line numbers with `plugins.bat.show_line_numbers`.

### editor

opens files and folders in your preferred editor.

- **enable:** `plugins.editor.enabled = true`
- **executables:** set the command to open files (`file_executable`) and folders (`folder_executable`).
- **keybinding:** the default keybinding is `e`.
- **suspending:** whether to suspend rovr when opening a file in an editor (recommended for TUI editors, disable for GUI editors for seamless workflow)

### finder
