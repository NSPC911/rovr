rovr provides a convenient right-click context menu that gives you quick access to common file operations.

## accessing the context menu

![context menu](/rovr/screenshots/right-click.svg)

you can open the context menu by:
- **right-clicking** on any file or folder in the file list
- the menu appears at your cursor position with relevant actions

## available actions

the context menu includes the following operations:

### copy

copy the selected file(s) to rovr's clipboard.
- equivalent to pressing `y` or `ctrl+c`
- works with multiple selections

### cut

cut the selected file(s) to rovr's clipboard for moving.
- equivalent to pressing `x` or `ctrl+x`
- works with multiple selections

### paste

paste files from rovr's clipboard to the current directory.
- equivalent to pressing `p` or `ctrl+v`
- handles conflicts with duplicate file names

### rename

rename the selected item.
- equivalent to pressing `r` or `f2`
- only available for single file/folder selection

### delete

delete the selected file(s).
- equivalent to pressing `d` or `delete`
- works with multiple selections
- uses recycle bin if enabled in config

### zip

compress the selected file(s) into an archive.
- equivalent to pressing `shift+e`
- supports multiple archive formats
- works with multiple selections

### extract archive

extract the contents of a compressed file.
- equivalent to pressing `ctrl+e`
- only available when an archive file is selected

### copy path

copy the full path of the selected item to your system clipboard.
- equivalent to the copy path button action
- copies the absolute path as text

## navigation with the context menu

when the context menu is open:
- **move up/down**: arrow keys or `k`/`j`
- **select action**: `enter` or click
- **close menu**: `esc` or click outside the menu

## double-click behavior

in addition to the context menu, rovr supports double-clicking:
- **on folders**: opens the folder (same as pressing `enter`)
- **on files**: attempts to open the file with the default application

the double-click delay can be configured in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[settings]
# time in seconds between clicks to register as double-click
double_click_delay = 0.25
```

## mouse scroll

you can also use your mouse wheel to scroll through the file list when hovering over it.
