### clipboard actions

- copy to clipboard: `y` or `ctrl+c`
- cut to clipboard: `x` or `ctrl+x`
- paste from clipboard: `p` or `ctrl+v`

### basic operations

- rename item: `r` or `f2`
- delete item: `d` or `delete`
- create new item (file or folder): `o` or `ctrl+n`

### archiving

- create a compressed file: `shift+e`
- extract a compressed file: `ctrl+e`

### visual/select mode

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/select-mode.svg" alt="select/visual mode" />

the main file list supports a multi-selection mode, sort of like vi's visual mode.

- toggle visual mode: `v`

once in visual mode, you can select multiple files:

- select up: `shift+up` or `shift+k`
- select down: `shift+down` or `shift+j`
- select page up: `shift+pageup`
- select page down: `shift+pagedown`
- select to start of list: `shift+home`
- select to end of list: `shift+end`

### mouse interactions

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/right-click.svg" alt="a mini popup from right-clicking an object" />

rovr supports mouse interactions for better usability:

- **right-click**: open a context menu for the selected file or folder with common operations
- **double click**: open the directory/launch the app

### extra copy

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/extra-copy-menu.svg" alt="another mini popup from right-clicking" />

in addition to copying to rovr's internal clipboard, you can also copy other things to the system clipboard:
- copy file path to system clipboard: `Y` &gt; `p`
- copy parent directory path to system clipboard: `Y` &gt; `d`
- copy selected file(s) as objects to system clipboard: `Y` &gt; `s`

keep in mind that copying files as objects may not work in all applications.
- on Windows: you need PowerShell 5.0
- on macOS: [clippy](https://github.com/neilberkman/clippy)
- on Linux: [xclip](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) or [wl-clip](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) is needed
