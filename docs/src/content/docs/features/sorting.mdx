{/* <add image> */}

rovr provides multiple ways to sort files and folders in the file list, allowing you to organize your view based on different criteria.

## accessing the sort menu

{/* <add image> */}

You can access the sort menu by:
- clicking the sort button in the action button menu
- the sort button displays the current sort order icon

## sort criteria

rovr supports the following sort options:

### sort by name

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files alphabetically by their name. This is the default sorting method.

- **keybinding**: `a` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (A-Z) or descending (Z-A)

### sort by extension

{/* <add image> */}

Groups files by their file extension, making it easy to find files of the same type together.

- **keybinding**: `e` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending or descending

### sort by natural order

{/* <add image> */}

Uses natural sorting, which handles numbers in file names more intuitively (e.g., "file2" comes before "file10").

- **keybinding**: `n` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending or descending

### sort by size

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by their size, useful for finding large or small files quickly.

- **keybinding**: `s` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (smallest first) or descending (largest first)

### sort by modified time

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by their last modification time.

- **keybinding**: `m` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending (oldest first) or descending (newest first)

### sort by accessed time

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by when they were last accessed.

- **keybinding**: `c` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending or descending

### sort by created time

{/* <add image> */}

Sorts files by their creation time.

- **keybinding**: `t` (when sort menu is open)
- **order**: can be ascending or descending

## toggling sort direction

{/* <add image> */}

You can toggle between ascending and descending order:
- **keybinding**: `r` (when sort menu is open)
- this reverses the current sort order

## folder positioning

rovr allows you to control whether folders appear before or after files:
- **keybinding**: `f` (when sort menu is open)
- options: folders first, folders last, or mixed (folders and files sorted together)

## persistence

Your sort preferences are maintained during your session and apply to all tabs.
