title: background processes
description: how rovr handles file operations and background tasks.
---

{/* <add image> */}

rovr performs file operations asynchronously, allowing you to continue browsing while tasks like copying, deleting, or moving files run in the background.

## the process panel

{/* <add image> */}

the process panel is located in the footer area (bottom of the screen) and displays all active and completed file operations.

### showing and hiding the panel

- **toggle footer visibility**: `shift+f` (hides all footer panels)
- **focus processes panel**: `f6`
- **return to file list**: `esc`

## process states

{/* <add image> */}

rovr displays processes with different visual indicators based on their state:

### in-progress processes

{/* <add image> */}

active operations show:
- a progress bar indicating completion percentage
- the current file being processed (if enabled in config)
- estimated time remaining (if enabled in config)
- real-time progress updates

### completed processes

{/* <add image> */}

successfully completed operations show:
- a checkmark or success indicator
- total items processed
- time taken to complete

### error processes

{/* <add image> */}

failed operations display:
- an error indicator
- error message describing what went wrong
- which file caused the error (if applicable)

## supported operations

rovr can run the following operations in the background:

### copy operations

{/* <add image> */}

copying files and folders runs asynchronously:
- supports copying single or multiple files
- preserves metadata (if enabled in config)
- shows progress for each file
- handles duplicate files with conflict resolution

### move/cut operations

{/* <add image> */}

moving files works similarly to copying but removes the source after transfer.

### delete operations

{/* <add image> */}

deleting files can be done with or without the recycle bin:
- supports batch deletion
- can use system recycle bin (if enabled)
- shows confirmation dialogs
- reports errors if files cannot be deleted

### archive operations

{/* <add image> */}

creating and extracting archives runs in the background:
- compression progress tracking
- extraction progress tracking
- supports multiple archive formats

### folder size calculation

{/* <add image> */}

when viewing folder metadata, rovr calculates the total size asynchronously:
- recursive size calculation
- updates in real-time
- doesn't block the main interface

## configuration options

you can customize how processes are displayed in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[interface]
# show estimated time for completion
show_progress_eta = false

# show percentage completed
show_progress_percentage = true

# show full file paths or truncate them
truncate_progress_file_path = false
```

## compact mode

{/* <add image> */}

in compact mode, the process panel automatically hides when not focused, giving you more space for file browsing. it reappears when:
- a new process starts
- you focus the panel with `f6`

to enable compact mode:

```toml
[interface]
compact_mode = true
```

## performance optimization

{/* <add image> */}

rovr uses several techniques to keep the interface responsive during heavy operations:

- **debounced updates**: progress indicators update at most every 250ms to avoid overwhelming the UI
- **async execution**: file operations run on separate threads
- **queue management**: multiple operations are queued and executed efficiently

for more details on these optimizations, see the [optimisation guide](/rovr/contributing/optimisation).
