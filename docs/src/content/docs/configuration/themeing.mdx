rovr can be themed in two ways, via the `config.toml` file and `style.tcss` file.

### config.toml

the config has a way to define themes using variables

```toml
[[custom_theme]]
name       = "<name>"
primary    = "<color>"
secondary  = "<color>"
warning    = "<color>"
error      = "<color>"
success    = "<color>"
accent     = "<color>"
foreground = "<color>"
background = "<color>"
surface    = "<color>"
panel      = "<color>"
is_dark    = true
variables  = { "<var>" = "<key>" }
```

you can take a look at the reference in [textual](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design), or the table below

| name       | description                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| name       | the name of the theme                                                                                                    |
| primary    | the primary color, can be considered the branding color.                                                                 |
| secondary  | an alternative branding color.                                                                                           |
| warning    | the default text color, which should be legible on `background`, `surface`, and `panel`.                                 |
| error      | a color used for the background, where there is no content.                                                              |
| success    | the default background color of widgets, typically sitting on top of `background`.                                       |
| accent     | a color used to differentiate a part of the ui form the main content.                                                    |
| foreground | a color with alpha that can be used to create layers on a background.                                                    |
| background | indicates a warning. typically used as a background color.                                                               |
| surface    | indicates an error. typically used as a background color.                                                                |
| panel      | used to indicate success. typically used as a background color.                                                          |
| is_dark    | used sparingly to draw attention and contrasts with `primary` and `secondary`                                            |
| variables  | custom variables that are used by textual. [variables](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design/#additional-variables) |

### style.tcss

styling in textual is handled by `tcss` files, a simplified version of the web's `css`. a reference is available in the [textual docs](https://textual.textualize.io/styles/)

you can get the full DOM list by running

```shell
rovr --tree-dom
```

`tcss` works the same as `css`, so, if you want to target the `FileList` inside the `#file_list_container` you can do

```css
#file_list_container > FileList {
  ...
}
```

however, if you took a look at the dom, or a truncated dom below

```
Application class="-dark-mode"
└── Vertical id="root"
    └── HorizontalGroup id="main"
        └── FileListContainer id="file_list_container"
            └── FileList id="file_list" class="file-list"
```

you may notice that inheriting of classes is not shown, `FileListContainer` inherits `VerticalGroup` while `FileList` inherits `SelectionList`. I will soon add support, but not just yet.
