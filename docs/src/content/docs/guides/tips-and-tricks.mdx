insane yap session incoming

## efficient file management

### batch operations
select multiple files and perform operations on all at once:
- use `ctrl+a`/`%` to select all files in the current directory
- copy/cut/delete operations work on all selected files
- you can search while in select mode

### clipboard operations
rovr provides an interesting clipboard management:
- yanking/copying will push it to the clipboard, and select them for pasting
- clipboard shows current selection and operations
- access clipboard panel by focusing it with `c`
- you can delete items, or unselect them from being pasted

### keyboard-only workflow
everything can be done without touching the mouse:
- use vim-style navigation (`hjkl`) for movement
- `enter` to open files/folders, `backspace` to go back
- all file operations have keyboard shortcuts
- press `?` to see the complete keybinding reference

## navigation stuff

### path history navigation
- **backspace** or **u**: go back to previous location
- **space**: go forward in history (after going back)

### pinned folders
pin frequently accessed directories for quick access:
- **shift+p**: pin the current folder
- pinned folders appear in the sidebar
- pins are saved and restored, and automatically updated across sessions

### quick jumping
- **ctrl+l**: focus path switcher, similarly to `explorer.exe`
- **f**: if `plugins.finder` is enabled, search for something in the current directory recursively using `fd`
- **z**: if `plugins.zoxide` is enabled, use `zoxide` to go to another directory

## advanced file operations

### archive management
rovr provides seamless archive handling:
- **ctrl+e**: extract archives
- **E**: compress selected files/folders into an archive
- browse inside archives without extracting them
- supports most common archive formats (`.zip`, `*.tar`, `.rar`)

### external integration
- **enter** on files: open with system default application
- external editor plugin available (disabled by default)
- configure with `file_executable` and `folder_executable` in config

## customization tips

### themes and appearance
- themes can be configured in `config.toml` under `[theme]` section
- built-in themes include "nord", "solarized-dark", "dark-pink" (more soon + overhaul)
- create custom themes with `[[custom_theme]]` sections
- transparency can also be enabled (at runtime as well using command palette)

### command palette
access the command palette for advanced operations:
- **ctrl+p**: open command palette
- search and execute any available command

### search and filtering
make finding files easier:
- **ctrl+f** or **/**: search in current directory
- search is fuzzy and matches partial names
- search results are navigable with arrow keys

## troubleshooting

### performance issues
if rovr feels slow:
- use yazi. thats it, this isnt meant to be fast, although i try my best, but this is python

### file operation problems
when files won't open or operations fail:
- **permission errors**: ensure you have appropriate file permissions
- **file associations**: check your system's default applications
- **network drives**: some operations may be slower on network locations
- **special characters**: be aware of filename encoding issues

### display issues
if the interface looks incorrect:
- try different themes with settings or f12
- ensure your terminal supports unicode and colors
- adjust terminal size if panels seem cramped
- check if your terminal font supports the icons being used

### getting help
when stuck:
- **?**: show the built-in help with all keybindings
- **ctrl+p**: use command palette to discover available actions
- check the error messages in the footer panel
- consult the [keybindings reference](/rovr/reference/keybindings) for complete shortcuts

## workflow examples

### photo organization workflow
1. navigate to photo directory with `ctrl+g`
2. toggle preview with `I` to see image thumbnails
3. select multiple photos with `ctrl+space` or `shift+click`
4. create new folder with `ctrl+n` for organization
5. move selected photos with `x` (cut) and `p` (paste)

### development project workflow
1. pin your project directories with `shift+p`
2. open multiple tabs with `n` for different project areas
3. use search (`ctrl+f`) to quickly find specific files
4. preview code files with syntax highlighting
5. open files in external editor with `ctrl+o`

### archive management workflow
1. select files/folders to compress with `ctrl+space`
2. create archive with `E` and choose format
3. navigate to archive and browse contents without extracting
4. extract specific files by selecting and using `ctrl+e`
5. clean up temporary files with `d` (delete)
