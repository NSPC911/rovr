rovr can be themed in two ways, via the `config.toml` file and `style.tcss` file.

### config.toml

the config has a way to define themes using variables

```toml
[[custom_theme]]
name       = "<name>"
primary    = "<color>"
secondary  = "<color>"
warning    = "<color>"
error      = "<color>"
success    = "<color>"
accent     = "<color>"
foreground = "<color>"
background = "<color>"
surface    = "<color>"
panel      = "<color>"
is_dark    = true
variables  = { "<var>" = "<key>" }
```

you can take a look at the reference in [textual](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design), or the table below

| Variables  | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| primary    | The primary color, can be considered the *branding* color. Typically used for titles, and backgrounds for strong emphasis.                    |
| secondary  | An alternative branding color, used for similar purposes as `primary`, where an app needs to differentiate something from the primary color.  |
| foreground | The default text color, which should be legible on `background`, `surface`, and `panel`.                                                      |
| background | A color used for the background, where there is no content. Used as the default background color for screens.                                 |
| surface    | The default background color of widgets, typically sitting on top of `background`.                                                            |
| panel      | A color used to differentiate a part of the UI from the main content. Used sparingly in Textual itself.                                       |
| boost      | A color with alpha that can be used to create *layers* on a background.                                                                       |
| warning    | Indicates a warning. Typically used as a background color. `text-warning` can be used for foreground.                                         |
| error      | Indicates an error. Typically used as a background color. `text-error` can be used for foreground.                                            |
| success    | Used to indicate success. Typically used as a background color. `text-success` can be used for foreground.                                    |
| accent     | Used sparingly to draw attention. Typically contrasts with `primary` and `secondary`.                                                         |
| is_dark    | A boolean indicating whether the theme is dark or light.                                                                                      |
| variables  | custom variables that are used by textual. [variables](https://textual.textualize.io/guide/design/#additional-variables)                      |

### style.tcss

styling in textual is handled by `tcss` files, a simplified version of the web's `css`. a reference is available in the [textual docs](https://textual.textualize.io/styles/)

you can get the full DOM list by running

```shell
rovr --tree-dom
```

`tcss` works the same as `css`, so, if you want to target the `FileList` inside the `#file_list_container` you can do

```css
#file_list_container > FileList {
  ...
}
```

however, if you took a look at the dom, or a truncated dom below

```
Application class="-dark-mode"
└── Vertical id="root"
    └── HorizontalGroup id="main"
        └── FileListContainer id="file_list_container"
            └── FileList id="file_list" class="file-list"
```

you may notice that class inheritance is not shown, `FileListContainer` inherits `VerticalGroup` while `FileList` inherits `SelectionList`. I will soon add support, but not just yet.
