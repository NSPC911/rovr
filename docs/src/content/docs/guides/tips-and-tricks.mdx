some simple tips

## clipboard operations
rovr provides an interesting clipboard management:
- yanking/copying will push it to the clipboard, and select them for pasting
- clipboard shows current selection and operations
- access clipboard panel by focusing it with `c`
- you can delete items, or unselect them from being pasted

## navigation stuff

### path history navigation
- **backspace** or **u**: go back to previous location
- **space**: go forward in history (after going back)

### pinned folders
pin frequently accessed directories for quick access:
- **shift+p**: pin the current folder
- pinned folders appear in the sidebar
- pins are saved and restored, and automatically updated across sessions

### quick jumping
- **ctrl+l**: focus path switcher, similarly to `explorer.exe`
- **f**: if `plugins.fd` is enabled, search for something in the current directory recursively using `fd`
- **z**: if `plugins.zoxide` is enabled, use `zoxide` to go to another directory

## file operations

### archive management
rovr provides some in-house archive handling:
- **ctrl+e**: extract archives
- **E**: compress selected files/folders into an archive
- browse inside archives without extracting them
- supports most common archive formats (`.zip`, `*.tar`, `.rar`)

### external integration
- **enter** on files: open with system default application
- **e** (vim) or **ctrl+o** (sane): open selected file/folder in your configured editor
- configure editor settings under `[settings.editor]` in your config:
  - `settings.editor.file.run`: command to open files
  - `settings.editor.folder.run`: command to open folders
  - `settings.editor.file.suspend`: suspend rovr when opening files (recommended for TUI editors)
  - `settings.editor.folder.suspend`: suspend rovr when opening folders

## customization tips

### themes and appearance
- themes can be configured in `config.toml` under `[theme]` section
- built-in themes include "nord", "solarized-dark", "dark-pink" (more soon + overhaul)
- create custom themes with `[[custom_theme]]` sections
- transparency can also be enabled (at runtime as well using command palette)

### command palette
access the command palette for advanced operations:
- **ctrl+p**: open command palette
- search and execute any available command

### search and filtering
make finding files easier:
- **ctrl+f** or **/**: search in current directory
- search is fuzzy and matches partial names
- search results are navigable with arrow keys
