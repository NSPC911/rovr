description: how rovr displays images in the terminal.

`rovr` uses the [`textual-image`](https://github.com/lnqs/textual-image) package to render images directly in the terminal. this allows for a rich file preview experience.

however, image support depends on the capabilities of your terminal emulator. different terminals support different image protocols.

### supported terminals

here is a summary of terminals and their support for the image protocols used by `rovr`:

| terminal           | tgp support | sixel support |
| ------------------ | :---------: | :-----------: |
| black box          |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| foot               |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| gnome terminal     |     ❌      |      ❌       |
| iterm2             |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| kitty              |     ✅      |      ❌       |
| konsole            |     ✅      |      ✅       |
| tmux               |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| visual studio code |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| warp               |     ❌      |      ❌       |
| wezterm            |     ✅      |      ✅       |
| windows console    |     ❌      |      ❌       |
| windows terminal   |     ❌      |      ✅       |
| xterm              |     ❌      |      ✅       |

> the `iterm2 inline images` protocol is not supported. see [lnqs/textual-image #68](https://github.com/lnqs/textual-image/issues/68) for more details.

### configuring the image protocol

if you are using a terminal that doesn't support the default image protocol, `textual-image` will fall back to a `half-cell` representation.

if images do not appear correctly, you can manually override the image protocol in your `config.toml` file.

<Code
  code={`[settings]\nimage_protocol = "Sixel"`}
  lang="toml"
  title="config.toml"
/>

available `image_protocol` values are: `"Auto"`, `"TGP"`, `"Sixel"`, `"Halfcell"`, and `"Unicode"`.

### configuring the image size

lets you configure the maximum width and height of image previews in pixels. by default, `rovr` sets these values to `1920` (width) and `1080` (height).

<Code
  code={`[interface]\nmax_preview_image_width = 1920\nmax_preview_image_height = 1080`}
  lang="toml"
  title="config.toml"
/>

don't worry, you don't need to look at scales and pixels to figure out how big the image will be in your terminal. `textual-image` automatically scales the image to fit within your terminal window while maintaining the aspect ratio.

### known issues

- some low-resolution images will look horrible, I'm not really sure why that happens, but it might be due to an unnecessary up-scaling attempt by `textual-image`
- opaque images do not get shown with a transparent background. this _used_ to work, but textual-image is just really scuffed (beggars cant be choosers). I may take a look some day, but the internals is too advanced.
