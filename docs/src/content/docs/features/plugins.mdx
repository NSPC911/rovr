import InlineSVG from "@/components/InlineSVG.astro";

there are a couple plugins to improve rovr's functionality. enable and configure them in your `config.toml` file.

### zoxide

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/plugin-zoxide.svg" alt="rovr's zoxide integration" />

[zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) allows you to zip around your filesystem, and can be integrated into rovr

- **enable:** `plugins.zoxide.enabled = true`
- **keybinding:** the default keybinding to open the zoxide dialog is `z`.

### bat

to allow for more file previews, [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) can be used for its syntax highlighting capabilities.

- **enable:** `plugins.bat.enabled = true`
- **executable:** specify the path to the `bat` executable if it's not in your system's `PATH`.
- **line numbers:** toggle line numbers with `plugins.bat.show_line_numbers`.

### editor

opens files and folders in your preferred editor.

- **enable:** `plugins.editor.enabled = true`
- **executables:** set the command to open files (`file_executable`) and folders (`folder_executable`).
- **keybinding:** the default keybinding is `e`.
- **suspending:** whether to suspend rovr when opening a file in an editor (recommended for TUI editors, disable for GUI editors for seamless workflow)
  - `file_suspend`: suspend when opening files (default: `true`)
  - `folder_suspend`: suspend when opening folders (default: `true`)
- **open all in editor:** set `plugins.editor.open_all_in_editor = true` to force all files to open in your configured editor, regardless of encoding or file type. when disabled (default), files that cannot be read due to encoding issues will open with the system's default application instead.

### fd

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/plugins-fd.svg" alt="rovr's fd integration" />

uses [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) to search recursively in the current directory

- **enable:** `plugins.fd.enabled = true`
- **executable:** set the executable used to call `fd`
- **relative_paths:** whether to see paths as relative or absolute
- **follow_symlinks:** search inside symlinks as well
- **no_ignore_parent:** do not respect ignore files from parent directories (e.g., `.gitignore`)
- **default_filter_types:** set default item filters (like `file`, `directory`, etc.)

### rg

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/plugins-rg.svg" alt="rovr's rg integration" />

uses [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) to search inside files

- **enable:** `plugins.rg.enabled = true`
- **executable:** set the executable used to call `rg`
- **case_sensitive:** whether the search is case sensitive
- **follow_symlinks:** search inside symlinks as well
- **no_ignore_parent:** do not respect ignore files from parent directories (e.g., `.gitignore`)
- **search_hidden:** whether to search hidden files and directories

### poppler

<img src="/rovr/screenshots/preview-pdf.png" alt="rovr's poppler integration" />

uses [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org) to preview PDF files

- **enable:** `plugins.poppler.enabled = true`
- **poppler_folder:** set the location where the poppler tools are installed (e.g., `/usr/bin` or `C:\Program Files\poppler\bin`).
- **pdf_batch_size:** number of PDF pages to load in each batch
- **use_pdftocairo:** whether to use pdftocairo instead of pdftoppm (may help performance)
- **threads:** number of threads to use for processing PDF files (default is 1)

### file(1)

uses the [`file`](https://darwinsys.com/file) command as an alternative to puremagic if it fails to detect a file's type.

rovr automatically detects `file` in your `PATH`, or you can set the `YAZI_FILE_ONE` or `ROVR_FILE_ONE` (higher priority) environment variables to specify a custom path.

- **enable:** `plugins.file_one.enabled = true`
- **get_description:** whether to get extra file description from `file -b <file>` (default: `true`)

a plugin system is also under works, stay tuned!
