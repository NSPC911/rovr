rovr's pinned folders feature allows you to quickly access your favorite or frequently visited directories through a dedicated sidebar.

## the pinned sidebar

the pinned sidebar appears on the left side of rovr's interface and displays a list of your saved folder shortcuts. it provides quick navigation to locations you access often.

### showing and hiding the sidebar

- **toggle visibility**: `shift+s`
- **focus sidebar**: `s`
- **return to file list**: `esc`

## managing pins

### pinning a folder

to pin the currently focused folder:
- **keybinding**: `shift+p`
- the folder will be added to your pinned sidebar

### organizing pins

pins are stored in the `pins.json` file in your rovr configuration directory. you can find this location by running:

```sh
rovr --config-path
```

the file structure is:

```jsonc
{
  "default": [
    {
      "name": "label",
      "path": "path/to/folder",
      "icon": ["<icon>", "<color>"] # optional
    }
  ],
  "pins": [
    {
      "name": "label",
      "path": "path/to/folder",
      "icon": ["<icon>", "<color>"] # optional
    }
  ]
}
```

### using path variables

rovr supports special path variables that work across different operating systems:

- `$DOCUMENTS`: user documents directory
- `$DOWNLOADS`: user downloads directory
- `$MUSIC`: user music directory
- `$PICTURES`: user pictures directory
- `$DESKTOP`: user desktop directory
- `$HOME`: user home directory (~)
- `$VIDEOS`: user videos directory
- `$CONFIG`: user config directory

**example**: `$HOME/projects` expands to `~/projects` on linux/macos or `%USERPROFILE%/projects` on windows.

## navigating pinned folders

{/* <add image> */}

when the pinned sidebar is focused:

- **move up/down**: `k`/`j` or arrow keys
- **select folder**: `l`, `right arrow`, or `enter`
- **search pins**: `/` or `ctrl+f` to open the search bar

### searching pins

{/* <add image> */}

the pinned sidebar includes fuzzy search functionality:
1. press `/` or `ctrl+f` to focus the search bar
2. type your search query
3. results are filtered in real-time
4. press `esc` to exit search

## default pins vs custom pins

rovr distinguishes between two types of pins:

- **default pins**: pre-configured pins that come with rovr
- **custom pins**: pins you've added yourself

both types are managed in the same `pins.json` file under their respective sections.
