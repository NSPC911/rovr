description: opening files and folders in your preferred editor.

rovr has options to change the default editor when opening a file, folder or when bulk renaming files.

### configure file editor
options:
```toml
[settings.editor.file]
run = "$EDITOR"
block = false
suspend = true
```
- run: the command to open files. `$EDITOR` will use your system's default editor.
- block: whether to block rovr until the editor is closed (recommended for GUI editors, like `code --wait`)
- suspend: whether to suspend rovr. ignores blocking (because it is already blocking execution). recommended for TUI editors, like `nvim`.

### configure file editor
options:
```toml
[settings.editor.folder]
run = "$EDITOR"
block = false
suspend = true
```
- run: the command to open files. `$EDITOR` will use your system's default editor.
- block: whether to block rovr until the editor is closed (recommended for GUI editors, like `code --wait`)
- suspend: whether to suspend rovr. ignores blocking (because it is already blocking execution). recommended for TUI editors, like `nvim`.

### configure bulk renaming editor
options:
```toml
[settings.editor.bulk_rename]
run = "$EDITOR"
suspend = true
```
- run: the command to open files. `$EDITOR` will use your system's default editor.
- suspend: whether to suspend rovr. ignores blocking (because it is already blocking execution). recommended for TUI editors, like `nvim`.

blocking is automatically enabled when bulk renaming files, as rovr needs to wait for the renaming to be completed before proceeding.

### additional notes
there is an additional option
```toml
[settings.editor]
open_all_in_editor = false
```
- open_all_in_editor: if enabled, rather than using your system's default opener, it opens them in the relevant editor configured
