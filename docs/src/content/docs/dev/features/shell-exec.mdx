rovr lets you run shell commands without needing to suspend or quit.

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/shell-exec.svg" alt="shell exec" />

## accessing shell exec

you can open the shell exec screen by:

- pressing `>` (or your configured keybind)
- the modal will appear with an input field for your command

## execution modes

shell exec supports three different execution modes, each suited for different use cases:

### background mode

runs the command in the background without blocking rovr. ideal for long-running commands that don't require immediate feedback.

- rovr remains responsive while the command executes
- you'll receive a notification when the command completes with stdout/stderr output

### block mode

runs the command and blocks rovr until it completes. suitable for quick commands where you want to wait for results.

- rovr waits for the command to finish
- displays stdout/stderr output in a notification
- ui remains visible but unresponsive during execution

### suspend mode

suspends the rovr process and gives full control to the command being run.

- rovr suspends completely, giving full terminal control to the command
- perfect for interactive editors, shells, or TUI applications
- rovr resumes after the command exits

## switching modes

cycle through execution modes by pressing `Tab` while in the shell exec screen. the border color indicates the current mode:

- **green**: background mode

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/shell-exec-background.svg" alt="background mode"/>

- **yellow**: block mode

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/shell-exec-block.svg" alt="block mode"/>

- **red**: suspend mode

<InlineSVG src="/rovr/screenshots/shell-exec-suspend.svg" alt="suspend mode"/>

## configuration

customize the keybind in your configuration file:

```toml
[keybinds]
show_shell_screen = [">"]
```
