rovr uses a background-highlighted option to show your currently selected item, and switches to a different colored text when unfocused.

### travelling in lists

- move cursor right/select option: `l` or `right` arrow key
- move cursor left: `h` or `left` arrow key
- move cursor up: `k` or `up`
- move cursor down: `j` or `down`
- go to the first item: `g` or `home`
- go to the last item: `shift+g` or `end`
